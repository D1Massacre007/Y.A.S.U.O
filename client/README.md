# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## 🌪️ Hook: *Imagine a Blade Forged in the Browser’s Fury*

What if your portfolio wasn’t just a static resume – but a **living, breathing entity**?  
One that **whispers your secrets**, **defends your code**, and **strikes down doubts with AI precision**?

Enter **Y.A.S.U.O** – not just a chatbot, but your personal **wind spirit**, slicing through questions about your projects, experience, and tech stack.  
Built in the crucible of **browser-only constraints**, it’s a testament to raw creativity:  
**no servers, no bills, just pure JavaScript alchemy summoning AI wisdom.**

## 📜 The Legend Unfolds: *What is Y.A.S.U.O?*

**Y.A.S.U.O** (*Your AI Sidekick Unleashing Opportunities*) is my ultimate **portfolio weapon** – a browser-native AI assistant that knows everything about me.

Ask it about:
- ⚔️ My **wildest projects**
- 🧠 My **battle-hardened experience**
- 🧩 My **arsenal of tech stacks**

It runs entirely in your browser — **zero backend infrastructure**, **zero ongoing costs**, just **lightning-fast JavaScript magic** simulating AI brilliance.

### Why Build This?

Because in a world of bloated cloud empires, I chose the path of the **ronin** –  
mastering fundamentals under limitation.  
No glued-together services — every decision a **calculated strike**, every line of code **intentional**.  

Trained on my **actual projects and data**, Y.A.S.U.O delivers answers sharper than most chatbots.

> Dive in, query away, and watch the wind obey.
