## 📜 The Legend Unfolds: *What is Y.A.S.U.O?*

**Y.A.S.U.O** (*Your AI Sidekick Unleashing Opportunities*) is my ultimate **portfolio weapon** – a browser-native AI assistant that knows everything about me.

Ask it about:
- ⚔️ My **wildest projects**
- 🧠 My **battle-hardened experience**
- 🧩 My **arsenal of tech stacks**

It runs entirely in your browser — **zero backend infrastructure**, **zero ongoing costs**, just **lightning-fast JavaScript magic** simulating AI brilliance.

### Why Build This?

Because in a world of bloated cloud empires, I chose the path of the **ronin** –  
mastering fundamentals under limitation.  
No glued-together services — every decision a **calculated strike**, every line of code **intentional**.  

Trained on my **actual projects and data**, Y.A.S.U.O delivers answers sharper than most chatbots.
